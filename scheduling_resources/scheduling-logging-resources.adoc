toc::[]

You can schedule logging resources by defining node selectors, taints and tolerations, and affinity and anti-affinity configurations. 

Node selector:: A node selector specifies a map of key-value pairs that are defined using custom labels on nodes and selectors specified in pods. For the pod to be eligible to run on a node, the pod must have the same key-value pair as the label on the node.

Taints and toleration:: Taints and tolerations control which pods should, or should not, be scheduled on nodes.

Affinity and anti-affinity:: Pod affinity and pod anti-affinity allow you to constrain which nodes your pod is eligible to be scheduled on based on the key-value labels on other pods.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you configure both `nodeSelector` and `nodeAffinity`fields, the conditions of both fields must be met for the pod to be scheduled onto a candidate node.
