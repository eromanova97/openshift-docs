== Bug Fixes

* Before this update, when using the new `1x.pico` size with the Loki Operator, the `PodDisruptionBudget` created for the Ingester pod allowed Kubernetes to evict two of the three Ingester pods. With this update, the Operator now creates a `PodDisruptionBudget` that allows eviction of only a single Ingester pod.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-6693[LOG-6693])

* Before this update, the Operator did not support templating of `syslog facility` and `severity level`, which was consistent with the rest of the API. Instead, the Operator relied upon the `5.x` API, which is no longer supported. With this update, the Operator supports templating by adding the required validation to the API and rejecting resources that do not match the required format.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-6788[LOG-6788])

* Before this update, empty `OTEL` tuning configuration caused a validation error. With this update, the validation rules allow empty `OTEL` tuning configurations.
