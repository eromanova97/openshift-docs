== Bug Fixes

* Before this update, logs without the `responseStatus.code` field caused parsing errors in the Loki `distributor` component. This happened when using the OpenTelemetry data model. With this update, logs without the `responseStatus.code` field are parsed correctly. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-7012[LOG-7012])

* Before this update, the Cloudwatch output supported log events up to 256 KB in size. With this update, the Cloudwatch output supports up to 1 MB in size to match the updates published by Amazon Web Services (AWS). (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-7013[LOG-7013])

* Before this update, `auditd` log messages with multiple `msg` keys could cause errors in collector pods, because the standard `auditd` log format expects a single `msg` field per log entry that follows the `msg=audit(TIMESTAMP:ID)` structure. With this update, only the first `msg` value is used, which resolves the issue and ensures accurate extraction of audit metadata. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-7014[LOG-7014])

* Before this update, collector pods would enter a crash loop due to a configuration error when attempting token-based authentication with an Elasticsearch output. With this update, token authentication with an Elasticsearch output generates a valid configuration. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-7017[LOG-7017])
