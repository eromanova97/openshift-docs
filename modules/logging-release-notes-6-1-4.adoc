== Bug fixes

* Before this update, Red{nbsp}Hat Managed Elasticsearch failed to receive logs if the index name did not follow the required patterns (`app-`, `infra-`, `audit-`), resulting in an `index_not_found_exception` error due to a restricted automatic index creation. With this update, improved documentation and explanations in the `oc explain obsclf.spec.outputs.elasticsearch.index` command clarify the index naming limitations, helping users configure log forwarding correctly.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-6623[LOG-6623])

* Before this update, when you used `1x.pico` as the LokiStack size, the number of delete workers was set to zero. This issue occurred because of an error in the Operator that generates the Loki configuration. With this update, the number of delete workers is set to ten.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-6797[LOG-6797])

* Before this update, the Operator failed to update the `securitycontextconstraint` object required by the log collector, which was a regression from previous releases. With this update, the Operator restores the cluster role to the service account and updates the resource.
