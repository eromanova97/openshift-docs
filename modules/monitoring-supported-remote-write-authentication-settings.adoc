|===

|Authentication method|Config map field|Description

|AWS Signature Version 4|`sigv4`|This method uses AWS Signature Version 4 authentication to sign requests.
You cannot use this method together with authorization, OAuth 2.0, or Basic authentication.

|Basic authentication|`basicAuth`|Basic authentication sets an authorization header with the configured username and password on each remote write request.

|authorization|`authorization`|Authorization sets the `Authorization` header on each remote write request by using the configured token.

|OAuth 2.0|`oauth2`|An OAuth 2.0 configuration uses the client credentials grant type.
Prometheus fetches an access token from `tokenUrl` with the specified client ID and client secret to access the remote write endpoint.
You cannot use this method together with authorization, AWS Signature Version 4, or Basic authentication.

|TLS client|`tlsConfig`|A TLS client configuration specifies the CA certificate, client certificate, and client key file used to authenticate with the remote write endpoint server using TLS.

The sample configuration requires that you have already created a CA certificate file, a client certificate file, and a client key file.
