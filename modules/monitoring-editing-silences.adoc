= Editing silences 

[role="_abstract"]
You can edit a silence, which expires the existing silence and creates a new one with the changed configuration.

.Prerequisites

* If you are a cluster administrator, you have access to the cluster as a user with the following role:
** The `cluster-admin` cluster role in {ocp}.
** The `dedicated-admin` role in {product-rosa-hcp} and {product-dedicated}.
* If you are a non-administrator user, you have access to the cluster as a user with the following user roles:
** The `cluster-monitoring-view` cluster role, which allows you to access Alertmanager.
** The `monitoring-alertmanager-edit` role, which permits you to create and silence alerts.
