= The monitoring stack in {product-dedicated} and {product-rosa}

[role="_abstract"]
In {product-dedicated} and {product-rosa}, when you install your cluster, user workload monitoring is enabled by default. 

With user workload monitoring enabled, you can monitor your own projects in isolation from Red{nbsp}Hat Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) platform metrics. You can monitor your own projects without the need for an additional monitoring solution.

The `dedicated-admin` user has default permissions to configure and access monitoring for user-defined projects.

Optionally, you can disable monitoring for user-defined projects during or after a cluster installation. You can also exclude individual projects from user workload monitoring.

== Support considerations

In {product-rosa} and {product-dedicated}, the following actions and configurations are not supported:

* *Installing custom Prometheus instances.* A custom instance is a Prometheus custom resource (CR) managed by the Prometheus Operator.

* *Modifying the default platform monitoring components.* You should not modify any of the components defined in the `cluster-monitoring-config` config map. Red{nbsp}Hat SRE uses these components to monitor the core cluster components and Kubernetes services.
