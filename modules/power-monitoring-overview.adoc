You can use {PM-title} to monitor the power usage and identify power-consuming containers running in an {ocp} cluster. {PM-shortname-c} collects and exports energy-related system statistics from various components, such as CPU and DRAM. It provides granular power consumption data for Kubernetes pods, namespaces, and nodes.
