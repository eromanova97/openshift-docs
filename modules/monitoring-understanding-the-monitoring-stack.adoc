= Understanding the monitoring stack

[role="_abstract"]
The monitoring stack includes the following components:

Default platform monitoring components::

A set of platform monitoring components are installed in the `openshift-monitoring` project by default during an {ocp} installation. This provides monitoring for core cluster components including Kubernetes services. The default monitoring stack also enables remote health monitoring for clusters.
+
You can see these components in the *Installed by default* section in the following diagram.
+
[NOTE]
====
In {product-rosa} and {product-dedicated}, Red{nbsp}Hat Site Reliability Engineers (SRE) use platform monitoring components to monitor core cluster components including Kubernetes services. This includes critical metrics, such as CPU and memory, collected from all of the workloads in every namespace.
====

Components for monitoring user-defined projects::

If you enable monitoring for user-defined projects, additional monitoring components are installed in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project. This provides optional monitoring for user-defined projects.
+
You can see these components in the *User* section in the following diagram.
+
[NOTE]
====
In {product-rosa} and {product-dedicated}, monitoring is enabled by default for user-defined projects.
