The following are examples of monitoring targets:

* HAProxy
* Image registry
* Kubelets
* Kubernetes API server
* Kubernetes controller manager
* Kubernetes scheduler
* OpenShift API server
* OpenShift Controller Manager
* Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)

[NOTE]
====
* The exact list of targets can vary depending on your cluster capabilities and installed components.

* Each platform component is responsible for its monitoring configuration. For problems with the monitoring of a specific component, open a
