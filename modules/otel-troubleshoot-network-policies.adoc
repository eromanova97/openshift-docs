= Disabling network policies

The {OTELOperator} creates network policies to control the traffic for the Operator and operands to improve security.
By default, the network policies are enabled and configured to allow traffic to all the required components. No additional configuration is needed.

If you are experiencing traffic issues for the OpenTelemetry Collector or its Target Allocator component, the problem might be caused by the default network policy configuration. You can disable network policies for the OpenTelemetry Collector to troubleshoot the issue.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a cluster administrator with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

* Disable the network policy for the OpenTelemetry Collector by configuring the `OpenTelemetryCollector` custom resource (CR):
