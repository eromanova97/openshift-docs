== Bug Fixes

* Before this update, the cluster logging installation page contained an incorrect URL to the installation steps in the documentation. With this update, the link has been corrected, resolving the issue and helping users successfully navigate to the documentation. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-6760[LOG-6760])

* Before this update, the API documentation about default settings of the tuning delivery mode for log forwarding lacked clarity and sufficient detail. This could lead to users experiencing difficulty in understanding or optimally configuring these settings for their logging pipelines. With this update, the documentation has been revised to provide more comprehensive and clearer guidance on tuning delivery mode default settings, resolving potential ambiguities. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-7131[LOG-7131])

* Before this update, merging data from the `message` field into the root of a Syslog log event caused inconsistencies with the ViaQ data model. These inconsistencies could overwrite system information, duplicate data, or corrupt the log event. This update makes Syslog parsing and merging consistent with the other output types and resolves the issue (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-7185[LOG-7185])

* Before this update, log forwarding failed when the cluster-wide proxy configuration included a URL with a username containing an encoded `@` symbol; for example, `user%40name`. This update adds the correct support for URL-encoded values in proxy configurations and resolves the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-7188[LOG-7188])
