= Enabling monitoring for user-defined projects

[role="_abstract"]
You can enable monitoring for user-defined projects in addition to the default platform monitoring. You can monitor your own projects without the need for an additional monitoring solution. 

Using this feature centralizes monitoring for core platform components and user-defined projects.
