== Bug fixes

* Before this update, collector pods would enter a crash loop due to a configuration error when attempting token-based authentication with an Elasticsearch output. With this update, token authentication with an Elasticsearch output generates a valid configuration. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-7018[LOG-7018])

* Before this update, `auditd` log messages with multiple `msg` keys could cause errors in collector pods, because the standard `auditd` log format expects a single `msg` field per log entry that follows the `msg=audit(TIMESTAMP:ID)` structure. With this update, only the first `msg` value is used, which resolves the issue and ensures accurate extraction of audit metadata. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-7029[LOG-7029])
