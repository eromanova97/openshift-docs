This release includes link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2025:1228[RHBA-2025:1228].

[id="logging-release-notes-6-0-4-enhancements_{context}"]
== New features and enhancements

* This enhancement adds `OTel` semantic stream labels to the `lokiStack` output so that you can query logs by using both `ViaQ` and `OTel` stream labels.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-6580[LOG-6580])

[id="logging-release-notes-6-0-4-bug-fixes_{context}"]
== Bug fixes

* Before this update, the Operator used a cached client to fetch the `SecurityContextConstraint` cluster resource, which could result in an error when the cache is invalid. With this update, the Operator now always retrieves data from the API server instead of using the cache.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-6130[LOG-6130])

* Before this update, the Vector startup script attempted to delete buffer lock files during startup. With this update, the Vector startup script no longer attempts to delete buffer lock files during startup.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-6348[LOG-6348])

* Before this update, a bug in the `must-gather` script for the `cluster-logging-operator` prevented the `LokiStack` from being gathered correctly when it existed. With this update, the `LokiStack` is gathered correctly.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-6499[LOG-6499])

* Before this update, the collector metrics dashboard could get removed after an Operator upgrade due to a race condition during the change from the old to the new pod deployment. With this update, labels are added to the dashboard `ConfigMap` to identify the upgraded deployment as the current owner so that it will not be removed.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-6608[LOG-6608])

* Before this update, the logging `must-gather` did not collect resources such as `UIPlugin`, `ClusterLogForwarder`, `LogFileMetricExporter` and `LokiStack` CR. With this update, these resources are now collected in their namespace directory instead of the cluster-logging one.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-6654[LOG-6654])

* Before this update, Vector did not retain process information, such as the program name, app-name, procID, and other details, when forwarding journal logs by using the syslog protocol. This could lead to the loss of important information. With this update, the Vector collector now preserves all required process information, and the data format adheres to the specifications of `RFC3164` and `RFC5424`.
