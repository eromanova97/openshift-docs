== New features and enhancements

The in-cluster monitoring stack for this release includes the following new features and enhancements:

Updated Prometheus to tolerate jitters at scrape time for user-defined projects::
With this update, the Prometheus configuration for monitoring for user-defined projects now tolerates jitters at scrape time. This update optimizes data compression for monitoring deployments that show sub-optimal chunk compression for data storage, which reduces the disk space used by the time series database in these deployments.
