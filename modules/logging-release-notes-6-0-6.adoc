== Bug fixes
* Before this update, the Logging Operator deployed the collector config map with output configurations that were not referenced by any inputs. With this update, the Operator adds validation to fail the `ClusterLogForwarder` custom resource if an output configuration is not referenced by any inputs, preventing the deployment of the collector.
